# Things I Learnt Today

### 20/10/2020

- Auth0 for multi-tenancy apps

  - Connection pools for filtering per tenant
    - Good for discrete databases or servers
    - Completely disconnects tenants from each other
  - Tenant information on app_metadata, sent as part of the access token
    - Secure information, which can't be changed by the user
    - Good for schema level or intra-DB level tenant selection
    - Requires a custom app layer to restrict resource to a tenant

- Leadership
  - What it means to be a tech lead
    - Aligning the team - Fostering a shared understanding of how the codebase should look. Code style, patterns etc.
    - Technical vision - Low-level view of tech used
    - Growing technical knowledge within the team - Mentoring, pairing. Don't want one person to be a lynchpin in the team
    - Technical risk management - Identifying potential problems waiting to surface and eliminating or mitigating them
    - Technical debt management - Knowing when to re-architect a component or service boundary
