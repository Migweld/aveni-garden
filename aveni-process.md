## Principles

- Go fast forever
  - Reduce cycle time
  - Increase developer confidence
  - Shorten feedback loops between users and engineers

### The workflow
- What processes can we get rid of?
- What can we automate?
  - Testing/Linting
  - Code complexity
  - Deployments
- What can we streamline without automation

### The metrics

  - Current hypothesis: Within or close to the target
- Rework
  - Target: Under 15% of re-authored code
