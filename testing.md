# Testing

> Test the contract that your software has with your user.

Testing against the implementation details of a system will leave you with a maintainability problems. The details of the implementation will change. The stable contract with your users, i.e. what you want the system to do, will not.

Test against the stable contract.

### Unit testing (Developer tests)

- Many people mistake the isolation of unit tests to mean the isolation of the system under test. The unit of isolation is the test itself. We must be able to run the test without prior input from other tests.

## Testing method

### Red - Green - Refactor

- Red: Write a test which **describes the behaviour** of your **public interface**. Make sure it fails.
- Green: Write code **quickly** to implement that behaviour. The will likely be awful, that's what we want. This stage is all about building a working implementation at speed.
- Refactor: Change your implementation so that it adheres to best practices. Remove code smells and DRY it out. At this point we're working on the code, **not the implementation**
