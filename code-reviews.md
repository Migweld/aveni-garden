# Code reviews

Who is ultimately responsible for the correct execution of the code (I favour the author)

## Objective, blocking issues

- **Errors that would cause an issue in production**
  - Syntax Errors
  - Infinite loops
  - Error handling problems (missing, incomplete etc.)
- **The stated goal of the change should align with the changes in the code**
  - Changes should be encapsulated within the scope of the stated change, extra little changes should be a seperate merge request
  - This is to make it easier to see where changes may have introduced bugs
- **The changes should align to the team's agreed coding standards**
  - If, for example, the team has agreed that all variables should be camelCase and the reviewer finds one that isn't, they should block the request

## Subjective, non-blocking issues

- **Anything which the reviewer personally disagrees with**
  - This addresses anything not covered in the blocking issues categories
  - Any feedback in this category is subjective and should not justify a block
