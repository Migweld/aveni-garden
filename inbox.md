## Things we want

- CI Pipeline improvements
- More tests

- Use of merge requests to ensure traceability
- Gitlab branch policies to automate adding of reviewers

- Crucial to make sure reviews don't become a bottleneck
  - Two reviewers is the ideal based on [research](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/publication/convergent-software-peer-review-practices/)
- Reviews increase knowledge sharing within the team
- Remove staging branch in favour of clean, tested code that can be confidently deployed or keep for discussion of ongoing features within the team(?)
