# Leadership

## What it means to be a tech lead

Aligning the team - Fostering a shared understanding of how the codebase should look. Code style, patterns etc.

Technical vision - Low-level view of tech used

Growing technical knowledge within the team - Mentoring, pairing. Don't want one person to be a lynchpin in the team

Technical risk management - Identifying potential problems waiting to surface and eliminating or mitigating them

Technical debt management - Knowing when to re-architect a component or service boundary

## A bit of introspection

Up until now, I haven't had to think about leading a team. In my previous job I was in a team of two with only slight overlap of skills. That meant for the longest time I was only managing my own time and my own development. There was nobody to delegate to. The buck stopped with me. However, I usually got my own way with tech choices.

Nowadays, I have to consider more people. There are high-level choices coming down from tech management, business concerns and timings from the wider management team and the wants and needs of the developers I work alongside. I'm also still a senior developer. My role is still one of an individual contributor within the team with some mentoring responsibilities. If I want to make the leap to a leadership position then I need to be preparing myself, practicing doing the job I want!
